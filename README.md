# Food Recipe App 🍽️

A responsive food recipe web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to search for food recipes and view detailed cooking instructions, ingredients, and related information in real time.

The application fetches data from **TheMealDB public API** and dynamically displays recipes based on user input.
